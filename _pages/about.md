I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working on drug discovery and synthetic biology with [Prof. James J. Collins](https://be.mit.edu/directory/james-j-collins).  Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Rice University, 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). I received the Bachelor degree from 
Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2015, and received the Master degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2018. 


My research interests lie in the broad area of large-scale graph data mining and machine learning, 
particularly in deep graph analysis, efficient graph representation learning, and the science applications in bioinformatics and graph quantum computing.
